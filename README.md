# Investing Aid

This application's main goal is to make it easy for any investor to keep track of his investments gains/losses.
Signed in users will be able to add trades in different currencies and keep track of their changes in any currency.
For this reason, an external Currency API is introduced (https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest).
